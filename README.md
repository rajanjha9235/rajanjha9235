### **GitHub Tip:**
- You can always find my repositories, pull requests, and activity contributions below. If you see something interesting, feel free to fork or contribute to the projects!

---

### **How to Set Up the GitHub Contribution Snake**

1. **Fork the Repository**: You can use [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Platane/snk) to create your own contribution snake for your profile.
2. **Set Up GitHub Actions**: The `snake.md` feature works with GitHub Actions to automatically create the contribution graph. When you push to your GitHub profile, the snake will grow, just like your activity.
3. **Embed in README**: Once your **snake.svg** is generated, simply link it in your `README.md` as shown above.

---

### **How the Contribution Snake Works**

- This snake-like pattern is created automatically based on the contributions you make on GitHub, like commits, issues, pull requests, etc.
- Every contribution is recorded and reflected in the graph, making your **GitHub activity** look like a snake that grows longer as you contribute more.
